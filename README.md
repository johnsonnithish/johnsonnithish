# Hello there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile; whether you are a recruiter or found my profile randomly or whatever it is, I hope you are impressed by my skills. If not, worry not I am always trying to improve myself.

## What I like to do

- Build web apps that are aethetically pleasing in such a way a normie doesn't need a guide to find the their way through the app. My aim is to make sure anything I build must be heavily user-friendly.
- Use the latest tech and resources at my disposal to solve my daily problems; however niche they maybe. 

## Programming Languages
- Python
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- Java
